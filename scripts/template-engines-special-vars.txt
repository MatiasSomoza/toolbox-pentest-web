# !!!WILL BE PUBLISHED VIA A PR TO SECLISTS REPO WHEN FINISHED!!!
# The objective of this dictionary is to help to discover the template engine used
# once a evaluation of a template expression was detected via the following dictionary:
# https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/template-engines-expression.txt
# Special variables are grouped by template engine in order to facilitate the identification.
# Use the term between the expression syntax identified as evaluated like "{{ xxx }}" for example.
# 
# Indicate to your fuzzer to ignore a line starting with: "# " 
# You can also filter the dictionary before to use via the command: grep -v "# " > dict.txt
