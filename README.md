# :factory: Welcome to my forge

<p align="center"><img src="forge.jpg"></p>

:clap: Image full credits go to **Dirk Hoenes**: `https://pixabay.com/users/ptdh-275507`.

🎯 The goal of this image is to provide an, always up to date "box", containing materials (tools + scripts) useful in the context of the assessment of a web-based application: site, API, etc.

⚙️ The image is based on the [kali-rolling](https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/official-kalilinux-docker-images/) base image without any [metapackage](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/) installed.

:iphone: Recently, I started to add content for mobile assessment to gather information/tools in a single box.

# :hammer_and_pick: Box enhancement approach

## Projects

* [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).
* [Nuclei templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates).

## Approach

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Toolbox
    participant S as SecLists
    participant N as Nuclei templates
    alt Is a missing discovery dictionary entry
        T->>S: Propose a PR with the missing element
        S->>T: Get update from the GitHub repository once the PR is merged
    end
    alt Is a missing detection generic point
        T->>N: Propose a PR with the missing template
        N->>T: Get update from the GitHub repository once the PR is merged
    end
    alt Is a missing useful existing tool
        T->>T: Add the tool in a way to always use the latest version
    end       
    alt Is a missing specific need or without existing tool
        T->>T: Add a new custom script
    end       
```

# What does it contain?

## Build

The folder **[build](build)** contains utility internal scripts used to build the docker image.

## Tools

All tools are installed in the folder **/tools** and a transfer zone between the container and the host has been defined via the folder **/tools/reports**.

## Helper scripts

The folder **[scripts](scripts)** contains helper scripts for some operations using embedded tools.

## Sandboxes with specific OS and/or runtime

The folder **[sandboxes](sandboxes)** contains utility docker files with specific OS/Runtime to create a specific sandbox.

The objective is to leverage the containerization to have a collection of quick sandboxes environment to test some specific behavior on a specific OS/runtime, for example, during a code review on an old version of a runtime (like PHP5).

The header of the dockerfile describes the target OS/runtime.

:satellite: All boxes are build and published to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/righettod) every month (images starting with `righettod/sandbox-`).

Command to use to build and/or run a sandbox:

:computer: By default, a ZSH shell with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is launched.

```bash
docker rmi -f righettod/[BoxName]
docker build --force-rm -t righettod/[BoxName] -f [Dockerfile] .
docker run --rm -v "[LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH]:/share" -i -t righettod/[BoxName]
```

## Misc

The folder **[misc](misc)** contains materials that can be used for testing specific cases like for example when an app is using:

* [HTTP Signature](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-12).
* [eIDAS certificate and key materials](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation).

## Templates

The folder **[templates](templates)** contains several scripts/files that can be used as a basis for custom scripts to speed-up the implementation of a POC.

## Dictionaries

The folder **[dictionaries](dictionaries)** contains several home-made custom dictionaries that can be used for discovery operations.

## Technical hints

This **[file](docs/README.md)** contains several technical hints for different kinds of context/issues/goals.

👀 It's a kind of cheat sheet.

# Build image locally

Use the following set of commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/righettod/toolbox-pentest-web.git
$ cd toolbox-pentest-web
$ docker build . -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web --file Dockerfile
...
```

# Container usage on a docker host for direct access

Native docker on Linux or MacOS:

```bash
# Create a volume to share files with the container (ex: reports)
$ docker volume create --name shared_space
$ docker volume inspect shared_space
# Run container
$ docker run -v shared_space:/tools/reports -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 -i -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web /bin/zsh
$ docker run -v shared_space:/tools/reports -p 192.168.206.128:80:80 -p 192.168.206.128:443:443 -i -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web /bin/zsh
# Build image into local cache
$ docker build -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web .
# Remove image from local cache
$ docker rmi -f righettod/toolbox-pentest-web
```

Docker for Windows:

```bat
rem Run container and defines a shared folder
C:\> docker run -v F:/SharedFolder:/tools/reports -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 -i -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web /bin/zsh
```

# Container usage for remote ssh access

> Private key to use for SSH authentication is [here](ssh-private-key.pem).

> This box is intended to be used as a toolbox for a short running period.

1. Run the container on the target docker host using the following command line:

```bash
$ docker run -p 22:22 righettod/toolbox-pentest-web
Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
Server listening on :: port 22.
...
```

2. Access the container, via SSH, using the following command:

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/ssh-private-key.pem root@[DOCKER_HOST_IP]
➜  ~
```

Add `"StrictHostKeyChecking=no"` in case of trouble with the remote keys because they are unique for each built image:

```bash
$ ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -i ~/.ssh/toolbox-ssh-private-key.pem root@[DOCKER_HOST_IP]
➜  ~
```

# DockerHub

Image is published [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/righettod/toolbox-pentest-web) each [day or at each commit](https://github.com/righettod/toolbox-pentest-web/actions) on the master branch.
