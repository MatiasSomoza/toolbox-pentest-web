# Objective of the image

The goal is to provide an, always up-to-date "box", containing materials (tools + scripts) useful in the context of the assessment of a web based application.

# What it contains?  

## Tools

All tools are installed in the folder **/tools** and a transfert zone between the container and the host has been defined via the folder **/tools/reports**.

## BEEF

> Beef RP certificate is self signed but BURP will be used between the victim and the container in order to made the certificate valid â†’ Burp CA will be installed on the victim.

Go into the folder **/tools/beef-conf** and run the script **start-beef.sh**.

## Helper scripts

The folder **[scripts](scripts)** contains helper scripts for some operations using embedded tools.

## Templates

The folder **[templates](templates)** contains several scripts/files that can be used as basis for custom scripts to speed-up the implementation of a POC.

## Dictionaries

The folder **[dictionaries](dictionaries)** contains several home made custom dictionaries that can be used for discovery operations.

## Technical hints

This **[file](docs/README.md)** contains several technicals hints for differents kinds of context/issues/goals. It's a kind of cheat sheet.

# Container usage on a docker host for direct access

Native docker on Linux or MacOS:

```bash
# Create a volume to share files with the container (ex: reports)
$ docker volume create --name shared_space
$ docker volume inspect shared_space
# Run container
$ docker run -v shared_space:/tools/reports -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 -i -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web /bin/zsh
$ docker run -v shared_space:/tools/reports -p 192.168.206.128:80:80 -p 192.168.206.128:443:443 -i -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web /bin/zsh
# Build image into local cache
$ docker build -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web .
# Remove image from local cache
$ docker rmi -f righettod/toolbox-pentest-web
```

Docker for Windows:
```bat
rem Run container and define a shared folder
C:\> docker run -v F:/SharedFolder:/tools/reports -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 -i -t righettod/toolbox-pentest-web /bin/zsh
```

# Container usage for remote ssh access

> Private key to use for SSH authentication is [here](ssh-private-key.pem).

> This box is intented to be used as toolbox for a short running period.

1. Run the container on the target docker host using the following command line:

```bash
$ docker run -p 22:22 righettod/toolbox-pentest-web
```

2. Access the container, via SSH, using the following command:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ssh-private-key.pem root@[DOCKER_HOST_IP]
```
