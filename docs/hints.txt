# Possible ways to perform a LPE ona linux
# See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfbwlPxToBc&t=3339s
# Way 1: Search for services listening on localhost and running as root then try to explore them...
netstat -anlp | grep LIST
# Way 2: Check if there is SPICE ports used.
# Spice is an open remote computing solution, providing client access to remote displays and devices
# The main use case is to get remote access to virtual machines.
# Ex: 5800/5900 for VNC
ps -eaf | grep [PORT] and check for SPICE port in the command line
# Use tool like remove-viewer to access to the console (apt install virt-viewer)
remove-viewer spice://[TARGET_ADDRESS]:[SPICE_PORT]
# Once on the login prompt:
# Reboot the VM via CTRL+ALT+DEL, 
# Edit the GRUB to have a shell as root (password recovery),
# Change the root password and then reboot the VM.
